The source code for the DBMS CS581 Project.
9. Readme - Source code - Running Instructions:
The application is hosted at http://saisrikanth.com/dbms/dir2.html [With Destination]
http://saisrikanth.com/dbms/dir.html [Without Destination]

The route will be given on the interface
Check the newfile3.txt which has the ‘waypoints’ details about the route and this waypoints are the path through which the user will go through. At, these waypoints the algorithm is recomputed.
